# Batch Operation

> Batch upgrade image

![Upgrade Container](_media/single-upgrade-container.png)

- `New Tag`: New image tag
- `Servers`: The servers in the current group (multiple server container names must be consistent, otherwise the upgrade will be unsuccessful)

> Batch clone image

![Clone Container](_media/single-container-clone.png)

The operation is same like creating the container, except for the server selection box at the top of the page, in order to avoid errors, currently only support multiple servers within a single group.
